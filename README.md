## Firestore Emulator

1. Install the Firebase CLI: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli
2. Once the Firebase terminal is open, navigate to the `napchart-website` folder.
3. In the Firebase terminal, use `firebase emulators:start --only firestore` to start the local DB.

NOTE: Make sure that you have a .env file in the root directory. This file has the API keys for Firebase.
